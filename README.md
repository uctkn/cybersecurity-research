European Parliament Cybersecurity Discourse Analysis (2014-2025)

Mixed-methods analysis of cybersecurity discourse in the European Parliament using dictionary-based quantitative text analysis and qualitative discourse analysis. This code operationalises securitisation theory and Corry's threat/risk framework to examine ideological framing patterns across 270 parliamentary speeches, revealing temporal evolution from balanced to threat-dominant discourse and persistent ideological divides between centre-left (risk-based) and centre-right (threat-based) security logics.
